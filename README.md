## About Me 
My name is Cade Dillon, and I'm currently transitioning into a new career in Software Engineering after 5 years of service in the United States Marine Corps. I joined the USMC after graduating from River View High School in Spring 2013, and after a lengthy initial training period, found myself in Pensacola, Florida studying Electronics Engineering.
  
I quickly became fascinated with the logic that made computers function, and was excited to begin working in electronics. Between 2015 and 2018 I was stationed in San Diego, California and Iwakuni, Japan where I led a Communications/Navigation shop of 20+ Marines in conducting electrical troubleshooting and assembly repair. In March of 2018, I enrolled in the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA), where I discovered software development to be a new passion of mine. I get a great deal of satisfaction from using my analytical problem solving skills to find inventive solutions to complex problems. 
  
My initial goal in Software Engineering is to become a full-stack developer on the .NET platform.

## About the Microsoft Software Systems Academy 

The Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) is an 18-week intensive coding program sponsored by Microsoft for Veterans and transitioning service members.

Primary focus of the MSSA program:

* Database analytics through SQL Server
* Software development with C# and Visual Studio
* ASP.NET and the Model-View-Controller framework to migrate apps into the cloud (Azure)
* Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions
* Design, program, and deploy apps that access organizational databases and provide end users with multimedia and information services
* Frameworks and the hands-on skills needed to position an app as a product and make it available through channels like the Windows App Store

## What I'm Currently Working On 

| Project Name | Application Type | Description | Project Goals |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
|[YogNatomy](https://github.com/cadedillon/YogNatomy)|MVC Web Application|YogNatomy is an app that seeks to make Yoga practice fun and intuitive for practitioners of all skill levels. All of the project's design documentation is in the YogNatomyDesign repository. For a complete overview, check out the PowerPoint presentation. |Project has moved into the implementation phase. Currently, I have implemented the DAL and am moving onto building key features into the business logic of the application. I have used Bootstrap templates and components to create a front-end with a cohesive look and feel.
|[RankingPokerHands](https://github.com/cadedillon/RankingPokerHands)|C# Console Application|This application generates 2 random poker hands, and ranks them according to the Texas Hold 'Em rule set. Currently in development.|After completing implementation of all Minimum Viable Product features, I want to expand this application to be a full Texas Hold 'Em game. This game would include: betting, dealing, user interaction for holding and folding, etc.
|[RouletteApplication](https://github.com/cadedillon/Roulette-Application)|C# Console Application|This application is a fully functional roulette wheel. What started as a simple class project quickly grew and expanded because I was having fun with it! | Currently in the process of adding comprehensive exception handling and range checks. MVC Web App GUI Coming soon.|
|[SnakesAndLadders](https://github.com/cadedillon/SnakesAndLadders)|C# Console Application| This application began life as a code wars challenge (Follow me on [codewars!](https://codewars.com/cade.dillontech)) but I found the concept intriguing and so I expanded upon it. Two players take turns "rolling dice" and moving up and down the game board as they land on either a ladder or a snake.|This console application is essentially in a finished state, however, I am currently working on an MVC Web App port of the game that will have a GUI and interactivity.|
[CodeWars](https://github.com/cadedillon/CodeWarsAlgorithms)|C# Console Application Algorithm Showcase|[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Cade.dillontech) is an online coding website where users create algorithms to challenge each other and become better developers. I've become an avid fan, and enjoy tinkering for hours on solutions that make me think outside of the box. Currently I have solved 30+ algorithms and am in the 91st percentile for honor (the websites point system).|My goal is to become a Rank 4 Kyu by 11/15, but mainly to keep improving my skills and having fun. Current Progress: ![alt text](https://www.codewars.com/users/Cade.dillontech/badges/large)|
