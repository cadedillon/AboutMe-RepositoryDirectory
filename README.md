# AboutMe-RepositoryDirectory
A brief professional summary of my life, what I find exciting about coding, a summary of the projects I've been working on along with a directory to those projects.

# About Me #
My name is Cade Dillon, and I'm currently transitioning into a new career in Software Engineering after 5 years of service in the United States Marine Corps. I joined the USMC after graduating from River View High School in Spring 2013, and after a lengthy initial training period, found myself in Pensacola, Florida studying Electronics Engineering.
  
I quickly became fascinated with the logic that made computers function, and was excited to begin working in electronics. Between 2015 and 2018 I was stationed in San Diego, California and Iawakuni, Japan where I led a Communications/Navigation shop of 20+ Marines in conducting electrical troubleshooting and assembly repair. In March of 2018, I enrolled in the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA), where I discovered software development to be a new passion of mine. I get a great deal of satisfaction from using my analytical problem solving skills to find inventive solutions to complex problems. 
  
My initial goal in Software Engineering is to become a full-stack developer on the .NET platform.

## About the Microsoft Software Systems Academy ##

The Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) is an 18-week intensive coding program sponsored by Microsoft for Veterans and transitioning service members.

Primary focus of the MSSA program:

* Database analytics through SQL Server
* Software development with C# and Visual Studio
* ASP.NET and the Model-View-Controller framework to migrate apps into the cloud (Azure)
* Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions
* Design, program, and deploy apps that access organizational databases and provide end users with multimedia and information services
* Frameworks and the hands-on skills needed to position an app as a product and make it available through channels like the Windows App Store
